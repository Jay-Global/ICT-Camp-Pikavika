## Contributing
Changes and improvements are more than welcome! 

I kindly ask to all contributors to make all new changes and features to a `new branch` wich is pulled from `develop branch`. Name the new branch in a way that it corresponds to the new code you're creating. 

**Pushing those updates back to your `own branch` to orhers to view before merging to the `main` or `develop` branch. Then together we decide when and what to merge and when to the actual application.**

If you can, please make sure code fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.
